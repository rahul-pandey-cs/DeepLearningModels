# This repo contain different models created using Keras tensor flow Backend(ANN, CNN, RNN, SOM, BoltzMann Machines, AutoEncoders)


Here we will work on Real-World datasets, to solve Real-World business problems. Here we will solve six real-world challenges:

Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem
Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition
Recurrent Neural Networks to predict Stock Prices
Self-Organizing Maps to investigate Fraud
Boltzmann Machines to create a Recomender System
Stacked Autoencoders* to take on the challenge for the Netflix $1 Million prize

## Prerequisites:

Keras with TensorFlow backend and Python installed

## Project setup: 



## Opening Jupyter notebook



## Trouble Shooting



### Steps to make your pip default to anaconda environment:




### Dependencies needed for working with fastai library( Also defined in environment-cpu.yml): 




### Use below pip command to install in one go:


### If problems in spacy.load('en')
